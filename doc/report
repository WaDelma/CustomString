Task was to create custom String akin the one in STL.
My solution is backed with array that is always power of 2.
The length of the backing array and string are maintained in class variables.
When the length exceeds/is equal of the backing array then array is grown to next power of 2.
Implementation doesn't check if after growing indexing is exceeded.
Implementation doesn't handle case where there isn't enough continuous memory for backing array.
Out of bounds indexing is checked with asserts for performance which means that without using debug mode bugs aren't apparent.
